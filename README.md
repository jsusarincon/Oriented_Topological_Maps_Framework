# Oriented_Topological_Maps_Framework
This code allows to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Time constrained exploration using toposemantic spatial models: a reproducbile approach" appeared in the September 2019 issue of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine 10.1109/MRA.2019.2923452  

This is the source code that is contained in the IEEE repository within a virtual box image.

You can download the user manual and read how to run the code.

WARNING: The virtual box image is already setup up to run the code following the user manual, if you are running this in your own machine/environment you need to refer to the last section of the user manual where I briefly explain the libraries you may need to install to have the code running.
